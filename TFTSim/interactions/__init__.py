"""
The interaction system package contains classes that represent
different particle interactions, based on how the particles are modelled (e.g.
as points, spheres, ellipsoidals).

An interaction should at least define a function that calculates the
1) acceleration of all particles due to interaction with eachother
2) potential energy of the system (typically the Coulomb Energy)
