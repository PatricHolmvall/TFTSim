TFTSim
========

TFTSim is a tool to simulate (classically) trajectories of fragments produced
in a Binary or Ternary Fission process, based on their Coulomb interaction right after
fissioning. TFTSim can be used to simulate a wide range of basic starting
configurations with varying geometrical and intial kinetic energy, based on
energy and total momentum conservation. The program uses a simple ode solver to
solve the equations of motion to produce particle trajectories, which are fit to
experimentally confirmed angular and energy distributions, in order to extract
information about what scission configurations are realistic.

TFTSim was last developed on Sep 13, 2013
